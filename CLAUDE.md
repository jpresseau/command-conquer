# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

**RC Command** is a browser real-time strategy game, deployed via GitHub Pages from `main`.
It ships as one generated, fully self-contained `index.html` (~0.13 MB) — no network calls, no
asset files, and **no libraries at all**. Every pixel and every sound is generated in code.

## Build — READ FIRST

`index.html` is a **generated artifact — never edit it by hand.**

1. Edit the relevant file under `src/`.
2. `python3 build.py` from the repo root.
3. Commit the `src/` change **and** the regenerated `index.html`.

`build.py` fails the build on: a syntax error in any source; two files defining the same
top-level name; or an external resource reference in the page. Do not remove those guards —
each one is there because the matching bug already shipped once.

## Layout

- `src/rts.rules.js` — **every balance number**, data only. Retune here.
- `src/rts.r3d.js` — the **sprite baker**: a small 3D rasteriser that runs once at load.
- `src/rts.sprites.js` — palette, terrain bake, ore, effects, and the 3D **models** for every
  structure and unit.
- `src/rts.audio.js` — all sound, synthesized at runtime with WebAudio. No sampled assets.
- `src/rts.core.js` — simulation: grid, A* pathfinding, combat, economy, enemy AI. Deliberately
  renderer-free, so a whole battle can be stepped headlessly. Swapping the 3D renderer for the
  2D one cost this file zero lines.
- `src/rts.render.js` — canvas 2D. Reads the sim, never writes it.
- `src/rts.ui.js` — sidebar, radar, HUD overlay canvas, input, main loop.
- `src/index.skeleton.html` — page shell + title screen; `src/style.css`.

## Presentation rules — these are load-bearing

Art is authored at **`RTS_TS` = 24 pixels per map cell**. The four rules below are the ones that
separate "looks like the game" from "looks like a web demo", and each is written down because
breaking it shipped once.

- **Never scale by a fraction.** Screen cells come from `RTS_ZOOMS` = 12/24/48 only — half, one
  and two art-pixels per screen pixel. A build that drew 24px art at 40px cells resampled every
  sprite by 1.667× and the whole picture went soft, with pixels of two different sizes side by
  side. `_rtsApplyCam` enforces this; do not reintroduce a free-running `cell`.
- **Structures and units are pre-rendered 3D, not drawn.** Westwood modelled them, rendered
  each to a bitmap at a fixed camera and light, and shipped the bitmaps — which is why the
  originals have volume and flat facets. `rts.r3d.js` does the same at load: models in 3D,
  baked to sprites, then the game is the 2D sprite engine it already was. No WebGL, no
  library, no per-frame cost. Unit facings come from yawing the *model*, so a tank at 45°
  shows its side and tracks properly.
- **The ground plane is not foreshortened.** Projection is oblique — `screenY = z - K*y` —
  because a 3×3 structure has to cover exactly 72×72 art pixels or it stops lining up with
  its tiles. Height projects straight up into headroom above the footprint.
- **Never leave a roof as one flat polygon.** With no yaw a plain box shows exactly two
  faces, so its roof is a single polygon of a single colour and the building reads as a
  shed. Structures use `_r3Slab` (chamfered top, which splits the roof edge into four
  planes at four angles and therefore four tones) or a `_r3Hip` roof. Two forms were tried
  and rejected: a plain gable, whose near slope covers five times the pixels of the far one
  under this camera, and a barrel vault, whose entire near half points at the light and
  lands on one shading band. The factory uses small repeated ridges instead.
- **The shading pipeline is the thing that decides whether this looks cheap.** Per pixel the
  baker keeps depth, base colour and a lit-ness value, then does: ambient occlusion off the
  depth buffer, ordered 4x4 dither, a colour RAMP, and a rim light on the up-left silhouette.
  Three rules inside it, each learned by getting it wrong:
  - **Ramp, never multiply.** Scaling RGB toward black desaturates as it darkens, so every
    shadow slides to muddy grey. The ramp keeps saturation in shadow and shifts it cool,
    and lifts highlights toward warm daylight.
  - **Dither the gradients, not the faces.** Dithering the face's own lighting puts a
    checkerboard across every large flat roof. Quantise the face value clean and dither
    only the spatially-varying part (occlusion, rim).
  - **Keep the specular tight.** A broad one (^8 at 0.34) pushed lit roofs past the top of
    the ramp and they blew out to pink.
- **A wall is never one flat colour.** Structures carry pale pilasters and rows of lit
  windows mounted 1.5 units proud of the wall face. Without them a building is a coloured
  box, however good its roof is.
- **Ore is discrete crystals with ground showing between them**, not a solid fill. A stain
  layer was tried and a rich field came out as a flat gold carpet with no texture at all.
- **Structures are faction-coloured, not concrete** (`RTS_PAL.bld`): coloured walls under
  maroon roofs, on a pale irregular concrete pad drawn by `_sprPad`. An all-grey pass read
  as an industrial estate, and buildings straight on grass read as furniture on a lawn.
- **Watch face winding and light direction.** Both failed silently and cost a round each: a
  cylinder wound the wrong way survives backface culling by showing you the *inside* of its
  far wall (stacks came out as dark discs), and a light with a negative z component lights
  the backs of buildings, leaving every front elevation at flat ambient.
- **The map is a landscape, not a field.** `_rtsGenTerrain` (in the *core*, since obstacles
  are simulation state) lays down conifer groves, thin rock ridges, a lake with a beach and
  dirt roads, into a second `G.terrain` layer of `RTS_T_*` codes that the renderer reads.
  Roads are carved last and connect the two start corners, which is what guarantees the map
  stays passable — always re-run a flood fill after changing obstacle density. Two traps
  found the hard way: canopy tones within a few points of the grass make the whole forest
  vanish into texture, and per-cell jitter smaller than about half a cell leaves the trees
  in visible rows. Rock is mottled per-2px with lighting **only on exposed faces** — a flat
  fill plus a per-cell lip turns a ridge into a paved plaza, and widening the ridge noise
  band even slightly collapses every ridge into one huge mesa.
- **Terrain is one baked canvas, not per-cell tiles.** `_rtsBakeTerrain` paints the whole
  112×112 map at art resolution using continuous fbm noise. Tiling six random 24px tiles per
  cell is what produced a checkerboard of axis-aligned brown squares: every patch was exactly
  one cell and the seams lined up into a visible grid. As a bonus the ground is now one
  `drawImage` per frame instead of ~2000.
- **Silhouette over surface.** Each structure must be nameable from across the map: the yard has
  a crane gantry, the power plant two stacks, the refinery silos and a dock, the barracks the
  only pitched roof, the factory a ribbed shed. A pass where all six were the same grey
  rectangle with a coloured stripe was unreadable at a glance.

Also load-bearing: units need **internal contrast** — hull, turret and tracks each a full tone
apart, or the unit reads as a solid brick. Ore is flat gold on the ground, stained at high
density and wrapped across cell edges so a field looks continuous rather than stamped.

Beware `_sprHash`: every multiply must be `Math.imul`. A plain `a * b` on two 32-bit ints
exceeds 2^53, the low bits come back as garbage, and the failure is silent — the first version
produced a terrain bake containing no dirt whatsoever because the "random" grade never crossed
its threshold.

## Structures animate

Taken from `BUILDING.H` in the GPL Red Alert source, which is a game-logic header but says
plainly what is meant to move — a structure is not one static bitmap:

- `MAX_DOOR_STAGE 18` / `DOOR_OPEN_STAGE 9` — the War Factory door is an animation, wide open
  at stage 9. Driven here off whether a vehicle is on the production line.
- `BState` / `QueueBState` — buildings have an idle look and a working look. Refinery and
  power plant blink while running.
- `Mission_Construction` — a placed structure assembles rather than sliding up out of the
  ground: rising reveal, a bright beam at the leading edge, and stippled rows above it so
  the boundary dissolves instead of being a hard horizontal cut.
- `Drop_Debris()` — a dying structure throws debris and fires secondary blasts across its
  footprint on a delay, instead of vanishing under one puff.

Animation state that is purely visual (door stage, blink phase) lives in `_rtsR.anim` keyed
by entity id, **not** on the entity — the simulation stays renderer-free, which is what lets
a whole battle be stepped headlessly.

## Verifying

No test suite — use headless Playwright against the **built** `index.html`. Node + Playwright
live at `/opt/node22` (do **not** run `playwright install`):

```
NODE_PATH=/opt/node22/lib/node_modules /opt/node22/bin/node <harness>.js
```

Serve the repo root, load `/`, click `#rtsGo`. Since `rts.core.js` is renderer-free you can step
`_rtsTick(1/60)` in a tight loop to simulate a whole battle in seconds. Worth re-checking after
balance changes: a passive player is overrun in a few minutes, a player who masses forces can
destroy the enemy base, and 40 units ordered across the map all arrive.

**"No errors" is not verification.** Three separate bugs here threw nothing at all: buildings
rendering pure black, music that was silent, and a START BATTLE button that did nothing. Measure
the output instead.

- Audio: tap an `AnalyserNode` on `_rtsA.master` and read RMS.
- Art: dump the sprites onto a sheet at 6–9× and look at them, and sample the baked terrain's
  pixel histogram — a palette entry at 0% means that material is not being generated.
